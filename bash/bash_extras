# Configuration for shared history across terminals

#
# Append to ~/.bash_history instead of overwriting it -- this stops terminals
# from overwriting one another's histories.
shopt -s histappend
# Only load the last 10000 lines from your ~/.bash_history -- if you need an
# older entry, just grep that file.
HISTSIZE=10000
# Don't truncate ~/.bash_history -- keep all your history, ever.
HISTFILESIZE=-1
# When displaying the history, add a timestamp to each entry
HISTTIMEFORMAT="%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S  "
# Don't remember trivial 1- and 2-letter commands.
HISTIGNORE=?:??
# ignoreboth is shorthand for ignorespace and ignoredups 
#   ignorespace: lines which begin with a spacechar are not saved
#   ignoredups: causes lines matching the previous history entry to not be saved.
HISTCONTROL=ignoredups
# Save each history entry immediately (protects against terminal crashes/
# disconnections, and interleaves commands from multiple terminals in correct
# chronological order).
PROMPT_COMMAND="history -a; $PROMPT_COMMAND"

# ideas
# Add automatic history rotation, ie once every day:
#   check if a rotation file for today exists, if not create one
#
# Add a command to 'squeeze' the history; ie remove lines that are identical
#   remove the oldest one!
#   Do not squeeze the last n files, because there you may need the full order of commands
